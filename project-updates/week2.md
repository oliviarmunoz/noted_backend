# Week 2 Project Updates

## Agenda
- Review development plan from functional design assignment last week
- Evaluation of concepts

## Progress Report
- Proof of concept with Spotify API; able to grab song information with corresponding spotify url and use search feature
- Settled on UI sketches and overall design look + feel
- Designed concepts/syncs, currently working on implementation
- Working on peer critiques

## Design Changes
- Addition of playlist concept for Listen Later and Favorites Feature (debated whether users should be allowed to make custom playlists as well)

## Issues
- None so far

## Plans & Decisions
- Moved around deadlines for concept implementation, authentication, and search due to upcoming peer critique deadline; aim to be done with concept implementation this weekend (Victor is leading this, but all team members are contributing)
- Meeting in person this weekend for alignment with front-end design and search capabilities
