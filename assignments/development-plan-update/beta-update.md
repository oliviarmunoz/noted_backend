## Updates to Risks and Mitigation

We have not updated our risks/mitigation for our development plan seeing as we are mostly on track with our alpha development plan. We may not be able to implement the recommendation system depending on time remaining, which means we will not use the Spotify OAuth system. This will reducie the need for fallback in the case that Spotify's system for authentication fails, since we will solely rely on our internal UserAuthentication concept. Users now have access to external links to Spotify songs, but this is not a focal feature of Noted; therefore, any external issue with spotify with this feature should not significantly impact user experience.
