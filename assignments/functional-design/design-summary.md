## Design Summary

The userAuthentication and Sessioning concepts work together to allow for multiple users to log in to our app, each with their own credentials. The userProfile is closely tied to these concepts but is open to changes from the user so they can customize their online presence in Noted. The Friending concept works together with userProfile to connect users to each other through the social networking aspect of Noted. The Review concept is the main part of our app, as it stores when a user makes a review on an item. This concept manages reviews of items as a concept that contains a numerical rating, the user who posted it, and an optional note. In addition, it allows other users (or the same user) to comment on any review made. Finally, the playlist concept manages the “Listen Later” and “Favorites” playlists. These playlists are automatically generated by the back end, but after initial creation, the user is free to add and remove songs from them.

A main feature of this app to tackle ethical concerns is the inclusion of the Spotify API. Through our testing, we were able to efficiently use this API to access the expansive library stored in Spotify. This addresses our concerns regarding the inclusion of as much music as possible to be fair between popular and lesser-known artists. In addition, we are staying within the bounds of the terms of use of this API, which addresses the main concern of legal issues between our application and Spotify. Some ethical issues that still remain, though, include those related to the regulation of the social networking feature. Although not explicitly stated in this functional design, we plan to implement regulations such as harmful word recognition at any point where users are uploading text (reviews, comments, bio, etc.). Throughout Noted, we also plan to work on issues related to accessibility, like support for multiple languages or visual impairment aids.
