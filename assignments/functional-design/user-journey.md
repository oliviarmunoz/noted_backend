# User Journey

Our user loves listening to music and discovering new songs recommended by friends. These recommendations come in from everywhere: Instagram, Messages, WhatsApp, and even Spotify itself. But because they’re scattered across multiple platforms, the user frequently loses track of songs, resorting to saving them in random playlists or phone notes that eventually get ignored.

They then discover Noted, an app designed to highlight the social and collaborative sides of music. At first, they don’t have any friends added, but they immediately notice features like the review system, as well as Favorites and the Listen Later folder. They begin adding all the songs they’ve been meaning to check out, finally organizing the backlog of recommendations they had forgotten about.

Curious about the review feature, they start writing their own thoughts on their favorite tracks. They enjoy capturing their reactions, whether about mood, rhythm, lyrics, or personal meaning, and find that reviewing helps them articulate what they like about each song.

Wanting to see what their friends think as well, the user invites them to join Noted. Soon, their friends begin posting reviews too, which appear on the user’s feed the moment they open the app. With each new review, the user discovers more music, easily saving anything that catches their interest to Listen Later.

Over time, the user becomes satisfied knowing they finally have a single place to store music they want to hear and a reliable space to get thoughtful recommendations. They also notice that conversations about music become more frequent among their friend group, sparked directly by interactions within Noted. In the end, the user feels a stronger sense of connection and community through the shared experience of discovering and discussing music together.
